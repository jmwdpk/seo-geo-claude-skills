**4 dimensions × 10 items = 40 evaluation criteria** for assessing domain authority in the Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) era.

**Sister benchmark**: [CORE-EEAT Content Benchmark](./core-eeat-benchmark.md) — content-level quality assessment (80 items).

---

## 1. Framework Overview

### CITE + CORE-EEAT: The Complete Picture

| Benchmark | Evaluates | Level | Items | Core Question |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| **CORE-EEAT** | Content quality | Single page/article | 80 | Is this content worth citing? |
| **CITE** | Domain authority | Entire domain | 40 | Is this domain worth trusting as a source? |
| **Combined** | Full assessment | Content + Domain | **120** | Should AI engines cite this source? |

### 4 Dimensions

| Dim | Full Name | Default Weight | Core Question | MECE Boundary |
|-----|-----------|:-:|---------------|---------------|
| **C** | Citation | 35% | How strongly is this domain referenced — through links AND AI citations? | All "others pointing to you" signals |
| **I** | Identity | 20% | How clearly is this domain recognized as a distinct entity? | Entity presence and brand recognition |
| **T** | Trust | 25% | Are there red flags suggesting manipulation? | All "is this suspicious?" detection signals |
| **E** | Eminence | 20% | How visible and influential is this domain? | Visibility, reach, and industry standing |

### MECE Boundary Rule

- **C** = positive referencing signals (links + AI citations + editorial endorsements)
- **I** = entity existence and brand coherence (who you are, not how visible you are)
- **T** = suspicion and manipulation detection (negative/defensive signals)
- **E** = visibility and influence outcomes (how much you're seen)

## 3. Scoring System

### Per-Item Scoring

| Result | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Pass | 10 |
| Partial | 5 |
| Fail | 0 |

### Score Calculation

- **Dimension score** = sum of 10 items (0–100)
- **CITE Score** = C × 0.35 + I × 0.20 + T × 0.25 + E × 0.20 (default weights)
- **Weighted Score** = C × w_C + I × w_I + T × w_T + E × w_E (domain-type-specific weights)

### Domain-Type Weight Table

| Dim | Default | Content Publisher | Product & Service | E-commerce | Community & UGC | Tool & Utility | Authority & Institutional |
|-----|:-------:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| C | 35% | **40%** | 25% | 20% | 35% | 25% | **45%** |
| I | 20% | 15% | **30%** | 20% | 10% | **30%** | 20% |
| T | 25% | 20% | 25% | **35%** | 25% | 25% | 20% |
| E | 20% | 25% | 20% | 25% | **30%** | 20% | 15% |

### Rating Scale

| Score Range | Rating |
|-------------|--------|
| 90–100 | Excellent |
| 75–89 | Good |
| 60–74 | Medium |
| 40–59 | Low |
| 0–39 | Poor |

### Veto Items

The following items can override the overall score — a Fail on any veto item caps the CITE Score at 39 (Poor) and raises a **Manipulation Alert**:

- **T03** — Thousands of links but near-zero organic traffic (link farm)
- **T05** — Near-identical backlink profile found on another domain (manipulation network)
- **T09** — Google manual action or deindexing (zero trust)

## 4. Domain Type Decision Tree

```
What is the domain's primary function?
├── Publishes articles, news, guides, or research     → Content Publisher
├── Sells/markets a product or service                 → Product & Service
├── Operates an online store or marketplace            → E-commerce
├── Hosts user-generated content, forums, or Q&A       → Community & UGC
├── Provides web tools, utilities, or applications     → Tool & Utility
└── Academic, government, non-profit, or standards     → Authority & Institutional
```

## 6. CITE + CORE-EEAT Integration Map

| CITE Item | Related CORE-EEAT Items | Relationship |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------|
| C05-C08 (AI Citations) | C02 (Direct Answer), O02 (Summary Box), E01 (Original Data) | Domain gets cited when content is citable |

| I04 (Schema.org) | O05 (Schema Markup), R09 (HTML Semantics) | Content-level schema contributes to domain-level coverage |
| I05 (Author Entity) | Ept01 (Author Identity), Ept02 (Credentials Display) | Content author signals build domain author recognition |
| T07 (Technical Security) | T03 (Security Standards) | Same signal, different scope (domain vs page) |
| E07-E08 (Topical Authority) | C03 (Query Coverage), E08 (Depth Advantage) | Content depth builds domain topical authority |

### Combined Diagnosis Matrix

| CITE Score | CORE-EEAT Score | Diagnosis | Priority Action |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| High | High | Ideal state | Maintain and expand |
| High | Low | Authority wasted on poor content | Prioritize content quality (CORE-EEAT) |
| Low | High | Great content, invisible domain | Build domain authority (CITE) |
| Low | Low | Fundamental issues | Start with CORE-EEAT, then CITE |

## 9. Common Evaluation Mistakes

| # | Mistake | Item | Wrong | Right |
|---|---------|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Ignoring AI citations | C05 | Only checking backlinks | Also monitor AI engine citations across major platforms |
| 2 | Counting total links, not domains | C01 | "We have 50,000 backlinks!" | Count unique referring domains, not total link count |
| 3 | Link quality conflated with quantity | C02 | 10,000 low-authority links = good | 200 high-authority editorial links > 10,000 directory links |
| 4 | Ignoring entity identity | I01 | Focus only on links and traffic | Check knowledge graph presence; it's how AI verifies sources |
| 5 | Neglecting Schema markup | I04 | "Schema doesn't matter for authority" | Schema helps AI engines understand your domain's scope |
| 6 | Not checking veto items first | T03 | Full evaluation before checking fundamentals | Always check T03, T05, T09 first — they can invalidate everything |
| 7 | Treating abandoned domains as trustworthy | T08 | "Old domain = authoritative domain" | A domain dormant for 3 years has decayed authority |
| 8 | Overlooking AI crawler policies | E04 | Blocking all bots for "security" | Review robots.txt; blocking AI crawlers kills GEO potential |
| 9 | Equating social presence with authority | E05 | "We have 100K followers = high authority" | Social presence is one of 40 items, not a proxy for overall authority |
| 10 | Using single-metric shortcuts | — | "Our Moz DA is 60, so we're good" | No single metric captures the full picture; CITE evaluates 40 signals |

---

## 10. Commonly Confused Pairs

When unsure which dimension a signal belongs to, use the MECE boundary rule (Section 1). For frequently confused items:

| Pair | Disambiguation |
|------|---------------|
| **C01 (Referring Domains)** vs **E01 (Organic Visibility)** | C01 = who links to you (input); E01 = where you rank (output) |
| **I09 (Unlinked Mentions)** vs **E06 (Media Coverage)** | I09 = any third-party mention without a link; E06 = authoritative media specifically |
| **I08 (Niche Consistency)** vs **E07/E08 (Topical Authority)** | I08 = how long you've stayed in one niche (identity); E07/E08 = how deep/broad your rankings are (visibility) |
| **C09 (Editorial Link Ratio)** vs **T01 (Link Naturalness)** | C09 = positive quality (what % are editorial); T01 = negative detection (is the growth pattern natural) |
| **T06 (WHOIS Transparency)** vs **I06 (Domain Tenure)** | T06 = is the registration suspicious (trust); I06 = how long has it been active (identity) |
