## Included MCP Servers

Pre-configured in `.mcp.json` (HTTP-based, no local setup required):

| Server | What it provides |
|--------|-----------------|
| Ahrefs | Keyword data, backlink profiles, site audits |
| SimilarWeb | Traffic estimates, competitive intelligence |
| HubSpot | CRM contacts, marketing analytics |
| Amplitude | Product analytics, user behavior data |
| Notion | Project documentation, content calendars |
| Slack | Team notifications, alert delivery |

To add more servers, edit `.mcp.json` at the project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-search-console": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-search-console-mcp-endpoint"
    }
  }
}
```

## How Placeholders Work

A skill might say:

```
Pull keyword rankings from ~~SEO tool and cross-reference with ~~search console impressions.
```

If your organization uses Ahrefs and Google Search Console, read it as:

```
Pull keyword rankings from Ahrefs and cross-reference with Google Search Console impressions.
```

## Progressive Enhancement Tiers

Skills are designed to work at three levels of tool integration:

| Tier | Integration Level | Experience |
|------|-------------------|------------|
| **Tier 1** | No integrations | Paste data, describe context manually. Skills still provide full analysis frameworks. |
| **Tier 2** | Basic MCP | Connect ~~search console or ~~analytics for automatic data retrieval. |
| **Tier 3** | Full integration | ~~SEO tool + ~~analytics + ~~search console + ~~web crawler for fully automated workflows. |

Every skill works without any tool integration (paste data manually). Connecting tools via MCP automates data retrieval but is never required.
